# Level of EU gas storage facilities
By Deniz Firat  
September, 2022

# Introduction
As the EU is approaching winter and people are worried about the gas storage facilities due to the current situation, I have evaluated and visualized the data of the gas storage levels since 2013 so that one can quickly get an up-to-date picture of the situation.

# Process
For data cleaning and analysis, I used RStudio, an integrated development environment for R. The exact procedure can be viewed [here](https://github.com/dfirat/eu-gas-storage/blob/main/eu-gas-storage.md).
I used Tableau to visualize the results, which can be viewed [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/dfirat/viz/LevelofEUgasstoragefacilities/Dashboard).

# Results
Although gas supplies from Russia to the EU have declined significantly, gas storage facilities are currently filling up noticeably. It is also worth highlighting that they are currently being filled at a slightly faster rate than the 2013-2021 average.
